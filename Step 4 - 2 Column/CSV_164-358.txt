BRONNIMANN noted that septa seemed to be shown in ~Ac.Ro1x's text-fig._ a, but later MAYNC (1953, ""1242, p. 148) 1nd1cated that neither true septa nor semiá septa are present in Discammina; also, he did not consider it to have a truly labyrinthic wall. Nevertheless, Discammina was shown _by LACROIX (193~, ¥1077) to be distinctly sep.tate, the thm septa resemblmg those of Ammoscalaria, as shown by the figures here reproduced. The difference in interpretation of wall structure is due to the different methods used for study. LACROIX illustrated specimens that had been injected with air, colored liquids, or a clarifying liquid (such as ""essence de girofle"") after treatment in al.cohol. These methods P.roduced an. appearance completely different from that obtained by thm sectioning. Bubbles introduced by the air-injection method gave specimens a ~omp~ex appearance. In transmitted light, however, shells identified by LACROIX are nearly transparent because of large clear quartz grains in the walls, which give no in.dication of truly labyrinthic structure. Hence the genus does not belong with Cyclammina, as suggested by LACROIX (1935, ¥1077) or with Ammodiscus, as he concluded earlier (19_32_, ¥1076). Although here placed in the Haplophrag.mo1dmae,. Dzs~ammz'!a is r~garded as distinct from Haplo.phragmotdes m havmg thm transverse septa (as in Am.moscalaria), which do not appear analogous to the aper.tural face. During the injection treatment LACROIX noted that the test was apparently imperforate, since the glycerin entered only at the aperture. This was regarded as evi.dence for a pseudochitinous base to the agglutinated test. The type-species was noted by LACROIX (*1077) to be a junior synonym of both Lituolina t'rregularis var. com.pressa GoE.s, 1882, and Haplophragmium emaciatum BRADY, 1884. Although Rhaphidohelix elegans Mosrns, 1880, was also _regarded as identical, this last appears to be distinct, and is probably a trochospiral rather than planispiral form.

DHRANcE's illustrations (1824, ¥I4lb, pl. 13, figs. 5, Sa,b) indicate that the species is a very lar ge form (3 mm. in length) and show that it definitely is biserial in the early stages. Later, DHRANCE (1828, ¥579f, p. 345) reported the occurrence of this species as ""fossile pri:s de Sienne, de Cascel-Arquato, et vivant sur les bords de la Mediterrante. d'Orbigny, loc . cit.)."" LAcr.01x (1929, ¥!074,  p. 2) st::!.ted thJt he had examined many thousand ex.:imples of T. sagi1111la from dredgings in the Bay of Biscay (Gulf of Gascony), the Engli sh Channel, and the Mediter.ranean, and that a true biserial specimen did not exist. All comp lete specimens seen by him exhibited an ea rly coiled stJge, although in some less perfect specimens this portion was broken or abraded so as to give a pseudobiserial appearance . On th e basis of dimorphism and of a su.tistical study LACROIX believed that a biserial form would   he impossible in this species as he observed both ""A and B forms"" with distinct coils. Following LACROix's work, some later investigators have considered Textularia and Spiroplectummina to be synonymous, although LACROIX considered both genera valid, differing only in rdJtive im.portance of the coiled portion of the test. BA~DY (1949,  ¥7 I) noted that some workers even placed the type-species of Textularia in Spiroplectammina, which Textuluria ante.d;.ited by more than a cencury .  In order to settle definitely the status of this genus we attempted to re-examine DE1áR:\NCE0S types, conducting a prolonged search for them while in France during 1953. 54. Since no trace of his coll ection could be found, the types are presumed to be lost. As noted above, DEFRANCE's original description gave no definite localit ies, whereas his later publication cited three localities in lt~dy-near Siena, :it Castel-Arquaro, and off the Italian coast living in the ~lediterranean. The Mediterrane:i.n is excluded from consideration as a source of topotype material, as too vague and not qualifying as a producer of ""fossil from Italy."" Both Castel-Arquato and Siena have excellent ex.posures of the Piacenzan (Pliocene), and both con t:iin numerous textularians. Specimens closest in appearance to the type description and figures were found at Sien:i. CusttMA:-.' (1945, ¥481) figured two specimens from Castel.Arquato, which he referred co ""Spiroplectamm ina sagittnlu"" but, like the majority of specim ens at Castel-Arquato, they were only about I mm. in length, and thus only one-third the length of DEFRANCE's figured type. Much more typical specimens occur at Siena :ind for this reason. as well as the fact that the Siena loc:ility was the first cited by DEFRANCE, we cons ider it to be the type locJ.lity.  Specimens of the species from Siena were found to be truly biser ial , as described for the genus, and they range from approximately 1. 35 to 2.57 mm. in length. It is quite possihle that for the species LACROIX described. no completely biserial form exists, but he was not studying DEFRANCE's Textularia sagi1tula. LACROix's specimens were all obtJined from Recent dredgings in areas remote from the type locality of T. sagittu/u in the Pliocene (Piacenzan) of northern Italy. Furthermore, LACR01x's specimens (fig. 2,3) were approximately I mm. long, much compressed, and with a rounded base, whereas DHRA:-.'cE's figured type has a length of 3 mm. (""un ligne et demi""). the base is quite pointed, and the original illustration shows con.siderable inflation of the test.

[The subgenus Pseudogaudryina was based on forms with few biserial chambers that had retained the triangular section of the test, but as this angularity commonly be.comes less pronounced with increased length of biserial development, it is regarded as a developmental feature and  not of taxonomic importance. The subgenus Siphogattdryina is based on Gaudryina stephensoni, which does not show the fistulose processes described for that subgenus, worn angles of poorly preserved specimens being so mistaken. Va/voreusse/la was stated to have a normally loop-shaped aperture, although some specimens have a terminal aper.ture in the biserial stage. Many species of Gaudryina show a tendency toward Tritaxia, by developing a random uniserial chamber and terminal aperture in gerontic speci.mens (TAPPAN, 1943, ¥1872, p. 78). The characters shown by the major part of the species population must determine the generic placement, hcwever. All specimens of Verneuil.ina bron11i illustrated by RI:.USS (¥1538), CUSHMAN (*470), and others show typical characters of Gaudryina, as do all but one of those figured by HoFKER (*948). Valvoreussel/a is therefore regarded as a synonym of Gaudryina. BowEN (1955, ¥!82) regarded Heterostome/la, Plectina, Dorothia, Marssonella, Karreriella, Bermudezina, and Migros as syn.onyms of Gaudryina, recognizing as generic characters neither the number of chambers to a whorl (triserial or multilocular trochospiral) nor the position and character of the aperture. Both features are regarded as of generic value by us. Bermudezina and Heterostomella are here regarded as valid genera of the Verneuilininae, Karreriel/a and Dorothia as valid genera of the Eggerellinae (with Marssonella a synonym of Dorothia), and Plectina as a valid genus in the Valvulininae.]   "	"Gaudryinella PLUMMER, 1931, "	"*1464, p. 341 [*G.  delrioensis; OD].
