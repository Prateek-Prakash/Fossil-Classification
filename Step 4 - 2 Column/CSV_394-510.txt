In the first place, it is a  named species, whatever its authorship and date, not  specimens identified by some later worker as belonging  to this species, that governs fixation of the type-species of  a nominal genus. OzAWA's (1928, *1401C, p. 131) cita. tion of the type-species of Staffella as ""genoholotype,  Fusulina sphaerica ABicH"" is germane only as an indi. cation of his intent, because the original publication con. taining an explicit type-species designation is sole au. thority and e\'idence for distinguishing it (Zool.

[Decision as to the correct name of this genus depends on  determination of the status of the original spelling in relation to regulations contained in Art. 32,a,ii, of the Code. The spelling Gallowaiina, in which the terminal letter of the name Galloway (referring to Professor J. J. GALLOWAY) is changed to ""i,"" may be construed as an inadvertent error in spelling this surname as a base for the generic name. If this is agreed to, as seems most reasonable, then Gallowaiina CHEN, 1934, is an incorrect original spelling which has neither separate status in nomenclature nor enters into homonymy (Art. 32,c). It is automatically correctable to Gallowayina, in which form it is a junior homonym of Ga!lotuayina ELLIS, 1932, and a substitute name is called for. Ga/lowaiinella CHEN in DUNBAR & SKINNER, 1937, is such a name, but it is de.fective in the same ways as Gallowaiina, since it contains the same, presumably inadvertent, error in changed spell.ing of the surname. This may be emended to Galloway.ine!liJ and this form seems to be most acceptable.

MaJgre le grande nombre de caractt:res ge':neriques qui la rapprochent de Fu.mlinella, l'allongement oblige a faire de cette forme un genre nouveau auquel convient }'appellation de Neofumlinella . ...""--~Thus it is clear that Neofusulinella was proposed for a described but unnamed form from the Permian limestones of Laos. It then became our problem to decide what this form was called when given a formal specific name. No men.tion was made by DEPRAT in 1912 of specimens from Indochina which he described in 1913 ('586, p. 40-44) as Neojus11linella praecursor and N. scluuagerinoides. DEPRAT's 1913 paper contains the following: ""Neofusulinella nov. gen. j'ai signal<! il y a quelque temps un nouveau genre de Fusulinidte dans les calcaires rapporti:s de Ban-Na-Mat, encre Sam-neua et Luang-Prabang (Laos) par mon ami et collC:gue M. MANSUY. Depuis j 'ai decouvert deux autres espC:ces, l'une dans les calcaires rapportCs du Tran-ninh, au N. de Xieng-khouang, par notre collaborateur le lieu.tenant Roux, l'autre des calcaires du Cammon, recueillis par le Commandant DUSSAULT dans des conditions trl:s bonnes au point de vue de la situation stratigraphique . . . . Je dCcrirai maintenant les trois esp2:ces de mon nou.veau genre. . . Neojusttlinella praecursor n. sp. se trouve a Ja base du Moscovien .... NeoftHlf/inel!a la11/t'JJOisi n. sp.... se trouve dans un calcaire clair de Ban-1\'a-Mat (Laos) recueilli par M. MANSUY .... Neofusulinella scluuagerinoides n. sp. est la seule espt:ce reprtsentte dans un niveau moscovien des calcaires du Cammon. . ""-.The selection of the type-species of i\'eofasulinella must be governed by the International Rules of Zoological 1"".o.menclature in effect in 1912. Article 30,I of these Rules reads: ""Cases in which the generic type is accepted solely upon the basis of the original publication."" Case c, Article 30,I states ""A genus proposed with a single original species takes that species as its type. (Monotypical genera.)"" The Rules do not state that the form must be a nominal species. The species for which DEPRAT proposed Neofusulinella was redescribed and named in 1913 as N. lantenoisi Deprat (¥586, p. 90). GALLOWAY & RYNIKER in 1930 (¥765, p. 23) designated Neojasuline/la praecursor as the type-species of Neofusulinella. In order for Neofusulinella praecursor to be designated as a substitute for N. lantenoisi, plenary action would be required by the ICZN, ar..d no such action has been requested.] (Note by R. C. MooRE.-One cannot disagree with THoMPSoN's st:it~ment of the record concerning Neofu.sulinella as just given or with his conclusion that DEPRAT actually based his recognition and initial description of this genus on the species later named N. lantenoisi. Even so, all this is irrelevant in applying the explicit stipulations given in Article 69(a) (ii) (3) of the Zoological Code (1961): Prior to 1931, ""If an author established a nomin:tl genus but did not designate or indicate its type-species, any zoologist may subsequently designate as the type-species one of the originally included nominal species, or, if there were no original nominal species, one of chose first subsequently referred to the genus.... If no nominal species were included at the time the genus was established, the nominal species-group taxa that were first subsequently and expressly referred to it are to be created as the only originally included species. . . If two or more nominal species were simultaneously referred co a nominal genus, all are equally eligible for subsequent type-designation."" Thus, in the case of .\'eo/11s11li11ella ""the only originally included species"" are ,\', j1r'1a11rsor, ,\'. lanlenoisi, and  N. schw,rgerinoidc>s and each of them is equally eligible for <le$ignation as the type-species by a first subsequent reviser. It happens chat GALLOWAY & RYNIKl:.R in 1930 (*765, p. 23) selected N. rraecursor, thereby fixing-the type-species in manner that is alterable only by ICZN using its plenary powers. THOMPSON has declined to   accept advice that the Rules must be followed in this way, holding the view (quite untenable in my opinion) that Neofwulinella is a monotypic genus based on a species un.named in DEPRAT's original publication but found to be one of three species de:.cribecl and named by this author in 1913. le is unnecessary to challenge THOMPSON'S curious interpretation of Article 30 of old niles because the XV Internacional Congress of Zoology (London, 1958) abrogated all such old rules when, in :tdopting the new Code, it in.cluded the regulation ""This Code comes into force on the day of its publiotion (6 November 1961) and all previous editions of the International Rules of Zoological Nomen.cbture are thereby superseded'' (Art. 84). Accordingly, the type-species of Neofusu!ilu:/la and the moJe of its fixation are incorreccly given by THOMPSON as printed above; the correct citation should read ""'* ,\'. praaursor DHRAT, 1913.

Because of the wide variety of forms included in Q. seminulum by various au.thors, the inadequate original description and figures, and loss of the original type, a neotype was designated from the original type locality and is here figured. The young megalospheric forms of Quinqueloculina were given the generic name Ade/osina by D'ORsIGNY, 1826. The original types of A. laevigata o'ORBIGNY are in the Mu.seum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris. A lectotype is here designated ('1395, pl. 20, figs. 22-24) and redrawn. The original figures show a distinct apertural tooth, but this was apparently broken away since the time of the original description; the tooth does not appear in the present figures.

This is because (I) all authors describing Eocene species from Africa and Europe have used it; (2) since adoption of Alveolina fo r recognition in my structural studies (1931, 1936-37) of the tests, the name has become the symhol of a well-defined and char.acteristic niorphological type that is common to all ob.served Paleocene and Eocene species; (3) deserving respect are the attempts of o 'ORBI CNY to estahlish priority of the name A/l'eolino since ""AlvColite de Bose"" was the oldest n3me (DESHAYES, 1828, p. 228) without doubt assigned to an Eocene form ( Alveolite grain de jh usque) fi g ured 9 yea rs before the Fasciolites of PARKINSON; and (-1) it has seemed desirable to avoid use of Fasciolites as defined by GALLOWAY on the basis solely of test proportions and size of chamberlets. But unfortun:itely these arguments are insufficient for the Rules of Nomenclature. The term AlvC:o.
