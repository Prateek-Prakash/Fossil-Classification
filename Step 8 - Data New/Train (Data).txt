Specimens with a single nucleus are rare, only one or two species being included, and as the number appears to vary even within a species, Antarcella is here regarded as synony.mous. Pyxidicula was originally described as a subgenus of the diatom genus Gallionella and the type-species was first described as a Frustrulia, later variously referred to Cymhella and Cyclotella.

BRONNIMANN noted that septa seemed to be shown in ~Ac.Ro1x's text-fig._ a, but later MAYNC (1953, ""1242, p. 148) 1nd1cated that neither true septa nor semi? septa are present in Discammina; also, he did not consider it to have a truly labyrinthic wall. Nevertheless, Discammina was shown _by LACROIX (193~, ?1077) to be distinctly sep.tate, the thm septa resemblmg those of Ammoscalaria, as shown by the figures here reproduced. The difference in interpretation of wall structure is due to the different methods used for study. LACROIX illustrated specimens that had been injected with air, colored liquids, or a clarifying liquid (such as ""essence de girofle"") after treatment in al.cohol. These methods P.roduced an. appearance completely different from that obtained by thm sectioning. Bubbles introduced by the air-injection method gave specimens a ~omp~ex appearance. In transmitted light, however, shells identified by LACROIX are nearly transparent because of large clear quartz grains in the walls, which give no in.dication of truly labyrinthic structure. Hence the genus does not belong with Cyclammina, as suggested by LACROIX (1935, ?1077) or with Ammodiscus, as he concluded earlier (19_32_, ?1076). Although here placed in the Haplophrag.mo1dmae,. Dzs~ammz'!a is r~garded as distinct from Haplo.phragmotdes m havmg thm transverse septa (as in Am.moscalaria), which do not appear analogous to the aper.tural face. During the injection treatment LACROIX noted that the test was apparently imperforate, since the glycerin entered only at the aperture. This was regarded as evi.dence for a pseudochitinous base to the agglutinated test. The type-species was noted by LACROIX (*1077) to be a junior synonym of both Lituolina t'rregularis var. com.pressa GoE.s, 1882, and Haplophragmium emaciatum BRADY, 1884. Although Rhaphidohelix elegans Mosrns, 1880, was also _regarded as identical, this last appears to be distinct, and is probably a trochospiral rather than planispiral form. The correct name for the type-species thus is Discammt'na compressa (Goiis) .]   "

MAcFADYEN (1933, '1197) noted that B. capita/a had originally been included in the perforate calcareous group by YAKOVLEV and on this basis, as well as general form, assumed it to be identical with Spiroplecta rosula EHRENBERG. Thus Spiroplectoides was regarded as a junior synonym of Bolivinopsis. FRIZZELL (1943, ?750, p. 338) stated that the synonymy was not positive. As the original description was based on a single specimen mounted in balsam, details of wall characters were uncertain and FRIZZELL stated that it is commonly difficult to distinguish between finely agglutinated tests and secreted calcareous ones. He added chat a study of topotypes would be neces.sary to settle the problem. CUSHMAN (1946, ?484, p. 102, 103) regarded B. rosula as ""calcareous, finely perforate,"" and 8.? clotho (GRZYBOWSKI) (==Spiro{'lectammina grzy.bowskii FRIZZELL) as ""entirely siliceous."" GLAESSNER (1947,  ? 796, p. 98) stated that Bolivinopsis should replace Spiro.plectammina, as the type-species was said to be arenaceous. SHLYKOVA in RAUZER-CHERNOUSOVA & FuRSENKO (1959, '*1509,   p.  219) recognized both Spiroplectammina and Bolivinopsis, placing both in the Textulariinae. As we have been un.able personally to examine topotype material of B. capi.tata, we follow this latter usage and recognize both genera.

DHRANcE's illustrations (1824, ?I4lb, pl. 13, figs. 5, Sa,b) indicate that the species is a very lar ge form (3 mm. in length) and show that it definitely is biserial in the early stages. Later, DHRANCE (1828, ?579f, p. 345) reported the occurrence of this species as ""fossile pri:s de Sienne, de Cascel-Arquato, et vivant sur les bords de la Mediterrante. d'Orbigny, loc . cit.)."" LAcr.01x (1929, ?!074,  p. 2) st::!.ted thJt he had examined many thousand ex.:imples of T. sagi1111la from dredgings in the Bay of Biscay (Gulf of Gascony), the Engli sh Channel, and the Mediter.ranean, and that a true biserial specimen did not exist. All comp lete specimens seen by him exhibited an ea rly coiled stJge, although in some less perfect specimens this portion was broken or abraded so as to give a pseudobiserial appearance . On th e basis of dimorphism and of a su.tistical study LACROIX believed that a biserial form would   he impossible in this species as he observed both ""A and B forms"" with distinct coils. Following LACROix's work, some later investigators have considered Textularia and Spiroplectummina to be synonymous, although LACROIX considered both genera valid, differing only in rdJtive im.portance of the coiled portion of the test. BA~DY (1949,  ?7 I) noted that some workers even placed the type-species of Textularia in Spiroplectammina, which Textuluria ante.d;.ited by more than a cencury .  In order to settle definitely the status of this genus we attempted to re-examine DE1?R:\NCE0S types, conducting a prolonged search for them while in France during 1953. 54. Since no trace of his coll ection could be found, the types are presumed to be lost. As noted above, DEFRANCE's original description gave no definite localit ies, whereas his later publication cited three localities in lt~dy-near Siena, :it Castel-Arquaro, and off the Italian coast living in the ~lediterranean. The Mediterrane:i.n is excluded from consideration as a source of topotype material, as too vague and not qualifying as a producer of ""fossil from Italy."" Both Castel-Arquato and Siena have excellent ex.posures of the Piacenzan (Pliocene), and both con t:iin numerous textularians. Specimens closest in appearance to the type description and figures were found at Sien:i. CusttMA:-.' (1945, ?481) figured two specimens from Castel.Arquato, which he referred co ""Spiroplectamm ina sagittnlu"" but, like the majority of specim ens at Castel-Arquato, they were only about I mm. in length, and thus only one-third the length of DEFRANCE's figured type. Much more typical specimens occur at Siena :ind for this reason. as well as the fact that the Siena loc:ility was the first cited by DEFRANCE, we cons ider it to be the type locJ.lity.  Specimens of the species from Siena were found to be truly biser ial , as described for the genus, and they range from approximately 1. 35 to 2.57 mm. in length. It is quite possihle that for the species LACROIX described. no completely biserial form exists, but he was not studying DEFRANCE's Textularia sagi1tula. LACROix's specimens were all obtJined from Recent dredgings in areas remote from the type locality of T. sagittu/u in the Pliocene (Piacenzan) of northern Italy. Furthermore, LACR01x's specimens (fig. 2,3) were approximately I mm. long, much compressed, and with a rounded base, whereas DHRA:-.'cE's figured type has a length of 3 mm. (""un ligne et demi""). the base is quite pointed, and the original illustration shows con.siderable inflation of the test. It seems obvious, therefore. th:i.t LACROIX was dealing with a completely differe nt species and genus, his form being a true Spirorlec1ammina; hence, it has littl e or no bearing on underst:i.nding of Textularia.]    C254 Protista-Sarcodina  4o   "

[The subgenus Pseudogaudryina was based on forms with few biserial chambers that had retained the triangular section of the test, but as this angularity commonly be.comes less pronounced with increased length of biserial development, it is regarded as a developmental feature and  not of taxonomic importance. The subgenus Siphogattdryina is based on Gaudryina stephensoni, which does not show the fistulose processes described for that subgenus, worn angles of poorly preserved specimens being so mistaken. Va/voreusse/la was stated to have a normally loop-shaped aperture, although some specimens have a terminal aper.ture in the biserial stage. Many species of Gaudryina show a tendency toward Tritaxia, by developing a random uniserial chamber and terminal aperture in gerontic speci.mens (TAPPAN, 1943, ?1872, p. 78). The characters shown by the major part of the species population must determine the generic placement, hcwever. All specimens of Verneuil.ina bron11i illustrated by RI:.USS (?1538), CUSHMAN (*470), and others show typical characters of Gaudryina, as do all but one of those figured by HoFKER (*948). Valvoreussel/a is therefore regarded as a synonym of Gaudryina. BowEN (1955, ?!82) regarded Heterostome/la, Plectina, Dorothia, Marssonella, Karreriella, Bermudezina, and Migros as syn.onyms of Gaudryina, recognizing as generic characters neither the number of chambers to a whorl (triserial or multilocular trochospiral) nor the position and character of the aperture. Both features are regarded as of generic value by us. Bermudezina and Heterostomella are here regarded as valid genera of the Verneuilininae, Karreriel/a and Dorothia as valid genera of the Eggerellinae (with Marssonella a synonym of Dorothia), and Plectina as a valid genus in the Valvulininae.]   "

[Decision as to the correct name of this genus depends on  determination of the status of the original spelling in relation to regulations contained in Art. 32,a,ii, of the Code. The spelling Gallowaiina, in which the terminal letter of the name Galloway (referring to Professor J. J. GALLOWAY) is changed to ""i,"" may be construed as an inadvertent error in spelling this surname as a base for the generic name. If this is agreed to, as seems most reasonable, then Gallowaiina CHEN, 1934, is an incorrect original spelling which has neither separate status in nomenclature nor enters into homonymy (Art. 32,c). It is automatically correctable to Gallowayina, in which form it is a junior homonym of Ga!lotuayina ELLIS, 1932, and a substitute name is called for. Ga/lowaiinella CHEN in DUNBAR & SKINNER, 1937, is such a name, but it is de.fective in the same ways as Gallowaiina, since it contains the same, presumably inadvertent, error in changed spell.ing of the surname. This may be emended to Galloway.ine!liJ and this form seems to be most acceptable.

""-.The selection of the type-species of i\'eofasulinella must be governed by the International Rules of Zoological 1"".o.menclature in effect in 1912. Article 30,I of these Rules reads: ""Cases in which the generic type is accepted solely upon the basis of the original publication."" Case c, Article 30,I states ""A genus proposed with a single original species takes that species as its type. (Monotypical genera.)"" The Rules do not state that the form must be a nominal species. The species for which DEPRAT proposed Neofusulinella was redescribed and named in 1913 as N. lantenoisi Deprat (?586, p. 90). GALLOWAY & RYNIKER in 1930 (?765, p. 23) designated Neojasuline/la praecursor as the type-species of Neofusulinella. In order for Neofusulinella praecursor to be designated as a substitute for N. lantenoisi, plenary action would be required by the ICZN, ar..d no such action has been requested.] (Note by R. C. MooRE.-One cannot disagree with THoMPSoN's st:it~ment of the record concerning Neofu.sulinella as just given or with his conclusion that DEPRAT actually based his recognition and initial description of this genus on the species later named N. lantenoisi. Even so, all this is irrelevant in applying the explicit stipulations given in Article 69(a) (ii) (3) of the Zoological Code (1961): Prior to 1931, ""If an author established a nomin:tl genus but did not designate or indicate its type-species, any zoologist may subsequently designate as the type-species one of the originally included nominal species, or, if there were no original nominal species, one of chose first subsequently referred to the genus.... If no nominal species were included at the time the genus was established, the nominal species-group taxa that were first subsequently and expressly referred to it are to be created as the only originally included species. . . If two or more nominal species were simultaneously referred co a nominal genus, all are equally eligible for subsequent type-designation."" Thus, in the case of .\'eo/11s11li11ella ""the only originally included species"" are ,\', j1r'1a11rsor, ,\'. lanlenoisi, and  N. schw,rgerinoidc>s and each of them is equally eligible for <le$ignation as the type-species by a first subsequent reviser. It happens chat GALLOWAY & RYNIKl:.R in 1930 (*765, p. 23) selected N. rraecursor, thereby fixing-the type-species in manner that is alterable only by ICZN using its plenary powers. THOMPSON has declined to   accept advice that the Rules must be followed in this way, holding the view (quite untenable in my opinion) that Neofwulinella is a monotypic genus based on a species un.named in DEPRAT's original publication but found to be one of three species de:.cribecl and named by this author in 1913. le is unnecessary to challenge THOMPSON'S curious interpretation of Article 30 of old niles because the XV Internacional Congress of Zoology (London, 1958) abrogated all such old rules when, in :tdopting the new Code, it in.cluded the regulation ""This Code comes into force on the day of its publiotion (6 November 1961) and all previous editions of the International Rules of Zoological Nomen.cbture are thereby superseded'' (Art. 84). Accordingly, the type-species of Neofusu!ilu:/la and the moJe of its fixation are incorreccly given by THOMPSON as printed above; the correct citation should read ""'* ,\'. praaursor DHRAT, 1913.

Alveolina ob/onga o'ORBIGNY was based on specimens col.lected by him from the Eocene (Cuisian) of France, and Fa _;ciolites PARKINSON was mentioned by o'Oae1GN \' as a  synonym of Alveolina. GAL LOWAY (1933, ? 762, p. !50) re. g:irded this as constituting subsequent monocypy (ICZN,  preference, ingrained by many years of usage, especially on the part of European paleontologists, including me, I have endeavored to find ways of conserv ing the name Alveolina , hallowed by tradition. This is because (I) all authors describing Eocene species from Africa and Europe have used it; (2) since adoption of Alveolina fo r recognition in my structural studies (1931, 1936-37) of the tests, the name has become the symhol of a well-defined and char.acteristic niorphological type that is common to all ob.served Paleocene and Eocene species; (3) deserving respect are the attempts of o 'ORBI CNY to estahlish priority of the name A/l'eolino since ""AlvColite de Bose"" was the oldest n3me (DESHAYES, 1828, p. 228) without doubt assigned to an Eocene form ( Alveolite grain de jh usque) fi g ured 9 yea rs before the Fasciolites of PARKINSON; and (-1) it has seemed desirable to avoid use of Fasciolites as defined by GALLOWAY on the basis solely of test proportions and size of chamberlets. But unfortun:itely these arguments are insufficient for the Rules of Nomenclature. The term AlvC:o.   Simpla lveol ina Cisalveolina  3  Mu ltispirina    l ite o f Bose is a vernacular name; o'ORB ICNv's figures in? tended for publication with his 1826 text were not pub.lished until much later.

(REtCHE L's (1936) publication of the nominal subgenus G/omalveolina failed to comply with requirements of  nomenclatural rules (Zoo!. Code, 1961, Art. 13,b) relat. ing to generic names published after 1930. These must be accompanied by definite fixation of a (valid) type? species. Glomalveo/ina had the status of a nomen nudum because its originally designated type-species was (and rema ins) a nomen nudum. This generic name was first validated in 1962 by HOTTINGER with designation of A/veolina dochelensis ScHWAGER as its type-species. The provisional use of A. dachelensis by Sc HWACER and attribution of G/omalveolina to REI CHEL by HOTTIN GE R have no effect on the validity of A. dachden sis and recog nition of HOTTINGER as author of G/oma/veo/ina. Also, the date of this nominal su bgenus mu st be given as 1962-not 1936.
