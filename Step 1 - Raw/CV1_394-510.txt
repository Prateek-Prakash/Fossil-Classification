C394 Protista-Sarcodina 
Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Arabia, Afghanistan, Thailand, Laos, western and southern China, Sumatra, and Japan. 
The stratigraphic relationship between this fauna! zone in the Eastern Hemisphere and the Zone of Polydiexodina in North America is not known. The association of Polydiexodina with Verbeekina in Afghanistan, in southern Turkey, and northern Iraq, and possibly in Greece, and the occurrence of Verbeekina faunas strati.graphically above typical Parafusulina faunas in southern China, strongly suggest that the Zone of Polydiexodina in North America is at least partly equivalent in age to the Zone of V erbeekina. 
Ammonoids indicate that the Sosio Beds of Sicily are early Guadalupian (Wordian) in age (*1280). The Sosio Beds contain several fusulinacean genera that occur in other areas in the Zone of Verbeekina, and therefore it seems probable that this Tethys Sea fauna! zone is in part slightly older than the Zone of Polydiexodina in North America. 
ZONE OF YABEINA 
The genus Yabeina occurs in some of the highest fusulinacean-bearing Permian rocks in the Eastern Hemisphere and ha5 been found in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon in the Western Hemisphere. Y abeina has been identified at numerous localities in the Eastern Hemisphere, in.cluding Tunisia, Crimea, South China, Cambodia, Thailand, and Japan. At several places Y abeina is known to occur strati.graphically above faunas of V erbeekina. Furthermore, the biologic stage of develop.ment of Yabeina and Lepidolina suggests that they are younger than early Neo.schwagerina. Rocks of Late Permian age that contain faunas of Y abeina and Lepido.lina are referred to the Zone of Y abeina. It seems probable that the Zone of Y abeina 
represents the youngest fusulinacean-bear.
ing rocks in the Eastern Hemisphere, and 
that the fusulinaceans became extinct in 
the narrow belt of Tethys that extended 
from Oregon in North America, westward 
across the northern Pacific region to south.
ern Asia, and farther west at least to Tu.
nisia in the Mediterranean area.

[The fact that OZAWA (•1401, p. 24) in designating

not be construed under stipulations of the Zoological 
Code (1961) to refer to fossils in the hands of VON 
MiiLLER (1878, •1295, p. 114) which he designated as 
Fustdinella sphaerica ABICH (1858) [1859], ==.Fusulina 
sphaerica ABICH, 1858 [1859]. DUNBAR (1933, •637A, p. 
131; 1940, •637B, p. 138) and subsequently THOMPSON 
(1935, "*1912, p. 113) were mistaken in judging that 
specimens described and illustrated by VON MOLLER, rather 
than ABICH's Furnlina sphaerica, must be recognized in 
defining characters of Staffel/a. In the first place, it is a 
named species, whatever its authorship and date, not 
specimens identified by some later worker as belonging 
to this species, that governs fixation of the type-species of 
a nominal genus. OzAWA's (1928, *1401C, p. 131) cita.
tion of the type-species of Staffella as "genoholotype, 
Fusulina sphaerica ABicH" is germane only as an indi.
cation of his intent, because the original publication con.
taining an explicit type-species designation is sole au.
thority and e\'idence for distinguishing it (Zool. Code, 67,

t.k>LLER's Fusulinel/a sphaerica and ABICH's Fusulina 
sphaerica are congeneric, both belonging to StaOella, but 
in his opinion they are not at all conspecific; therefore, 
in order to a\'Oid homonymy of specific names he pub.
lished Staffella moellerana as designation for VON MOurn's 
specimens. S. moellerana THOMPSON is not the type-species 
of Staffella, despite OzAwA's admission, quoted by DUNBAR 
(1940, '637B, p. 138), that he based his choice of type.

determination of the status of the original spelling in relation to regulations contained in Art. 32,a,ii, of the Code. The spelling Gallowaiina, in which the terminal letter of the name Galloway (referring to Professor J. J. GALLOWAY) is changed to "i," may be construed as an inadvertent error in spelling this surname as a base for the generic name. If this is agreed to, as seems most reasonable, then Gallowaiina CHEN, 1934, is an incorrect original spelling which has neither separate status in nomenclature nor enters into homonymy (Art. 32,c). It is automatically correctable to Gallowayina, in which form it is a junior homonym of Ga!lotuayina ELLIS, 1932, and a substitute name is called for. Ga/lowaiinella CHEN in DUNBAR & SKINNER, 1937, is such a name, but it is de.fective in the same ways as Gallowaiina, since it contains the same, presumably inadvertent, error in changed spell.ing of the surname. This may be emended to Galloway.ine!liJ and this form seems to be most acceptable. Other· wise, it would be necessary to recognize the validity of Gtl/lowaiina, since it differs by a single letter from Gallo.wayina (Art. 56,a) .]

[When DEPRAT (1912, •585, p. 1549) proposed the name Neofumlindla he stated that it was for a form from the Permian limestones at Barn-Na-Mat, between Sam-Neua and Luang-Prabang, writin¥ as follow~: "Neofurnlinella.

MaJgre le grande nombre de caractt:res ge':neriques qui la rapprochent de Fu.mlinella, l'allongement oblige a faire de cette forme un genre nouveau auquel convient }'appellation de Neofumlinella . ..."--~Thus it is clear that Neofusulinella was proposed for a described but unnamed form from the Permian limestones of Laos. It then became our problem to decide what this form was called when given a formal specific name. No men.tion was made by DEPRAT in 1912 of specimens from Indochina which he described in 1913 ('586, p. 40-44) as Neojus11linella praecursor and N. scluuagerinoides. DEPRAT's 1913 paper contains the following: "Neofusulinella nov. gen. j'ai signal<! il y a quelque temps un nouveau genre de Fusulinidte dans les calcaires rapporti:s de Ban-Na-Mat, encre Sam-neua et Luang-Prabang (Laos) par mon ami et collC:gue M.

Neofusulinella scluuagerinoides n. sp. est la seule espt:ce reprtsentte dans un niveau moscovien des calcaires du Cammon. . "-.The selection of the type-species of i\'eofasulinella must be governed by the International Rules of Zoological 1".o.menclature in effect in 1912. Article 30,I of these Rules reads: "Cases in which the generic type is accepted solely upon the basis of the original publication." Case c, Article 30,I states "A genus proposed with a single original species takes that species as its type. (Monotypical genera.)" The Rules do not state that the form must be a nominal species. The species for which DEPRAT proposed Neofusulinella was redescribed and named in 1913 as N. lantenoisi Deprat (•586, p. 90). GALLOWAY & RYNIKER in 1930 (•765, p. 23) designated Neojasuline/la praecursor as the type-species of Neofusulinella. In order for Neofusulinella praecursor to be designated as a substitute for N. lantenoisi, plenary action would be required by the ICZN, ar..d no such action has been requested.] (Note by R. C. MooRE.-One cannot disagree with THoMPSoN's st:it~ment of the record concerning Neofu.sulinella as just given or with his conclusion that DEPRAT actually based his recognition and initial description of this genus on the species later named N. lantenoisi. Even so, all this is irrelevant in applying the explicit stipulations given in Article 69(a) (ii) (3) of the Zoological Code (1961): Prior to 1931, "If an author established a nomin:tl genus but did not designate or indicate its type-species, any zoologist may subsequently designate as the type-species one of the originally included nominal species, or, if there were no original nominal species, one of chose first subsequently referred to the genus.... If no nominal species were included at the time the genus was established, the nominal species-group taxa that were first subsequently and expressly referred to it are to be created as the only originally included species. . . If two or more nominal species were simultaneously referred co a nominal genus, all are equally eligible for subsequent type-designation." Thus, in the case of .\'eo/11s11li11ella "the only originally included species" are ,\', j1r'1a11rsor, ,\'. lanlenoisi, and 
N. schw,rgerinoidc>s and each of them is equally eligible for <le$ignation as the type-species by a first subsequent reviser. It happens chat GALLOWAY & RYNIKl:.R in 1930 (*765, p. 23) selected N. rraecursor, thereby fixing-the type-species in manner that is alterable only by ICZN using its plenary powers. THOMPSON has declined to 

accept advice that the Rules must be followed in this way, holding the view (quite untenable in my opinion) that Neofwulinella is a monotypic genus based on a species un.named in DEPRAT's original publication but found to be one of three species de:.cribecl and named by this author in 1913. le is unnecessary to challenge THOMPSON'S curious interpretation of Article 30 of old niles because the XV Internacional Congress of Zoology (London, 1958) abrogated all such old rules when, in :tdopting the new Code, it in.cluded the regulation "This Code comes into force on the day of its publiotion (6 November 1961) and all previous editions of the International Rules of Zoological Nomen.cbture are thereby superseded'' (Art. 84). Accordingly, the type-species of Neofusu!ilu:/la and the moJe of its fixation are incorreccly given by THOMPSON as printed above; the correct citation should read "'* ,\'. praaursor DHRAT, 1913.

GENERA OF UNCERTAIN

The following alphabetically arranged nominal genera of fusulinacean foramini.fers are those for which I have insufficient information for analysis or thorough un.derstanding. For such completeness as is possible now, I record what I know about them. These names were brought together by M. L. THOMPSON and R. ToRIYAMA in Japan, and by A. R. LoEBLICH, JR., and HELEN TAPPAN.

Tn1ANSKAYA gave the following diagno.sis: "The new subgenus Lantsc11ic!ttes differs from the genus Codonofusiella by the different form of its shell: by its elongated, almost cylindrical form and broadly rounded sides at the poles. The septa! folding is considerably more developed and septa occupy almost all of a volution.

Eostaf}e/loides resembles C henella in most respects except that Eostaf}elloides does not have an abrupt increase in height of the last volution and the wall of the body whorls does not contain a diaphanotheca. The shell is lens-shaped and measures about 0.4 mm. in axial length and 0.7 mm. in width. The diameter of the proloculus of one specimen was given as 0.03 mm. and heights of succeeding volutions as 0.06 (!st) , 0.11 (2nd), 0.20 (3rd), 
0.37 (4th), and 0.70 (5th). The chomata are triangular in outline. The genus originally was placed in the Ozawainellinae. U.Perm., Asia (USSR). 

Fujimotoella MoRIKAWA, 1952, •J312A, p. 36 [•F. umblicata; OD]. The type-specimens of F. um.blicata are badly crushed . They are large and have large proloculi. The shell is loosely coiled throughout. The septa are closely spaced and seem to be entirely unfluted . Considerable evidence is shown on many of the illustrations that the axial areas are highly filled with dense calcite which is closely similar to axial fillings in speci.mens of Wedekindellina DuNBAR & HENBEST, 1933. The author described Fujimotoella as be.ing like Triticites GIRTY, 1904, but the types seem to be too poorly preserved for comparison or for generic definition. Perm., Japan.

The designation of type-species was somewhat ambiguous, as an error in typesetting placed the line "Tip roda Reichelina cribroseptata ERK, 1941" 
[1942] in two places (p. 991, line 25 and line 37) erroneously indicating it as type of both

(p. 991, preceding the above-mentioned error) stated definitely that the new name Moscoviella was there proposed for the group of Carboniferous foraminifers, for which the type is Ozawainella mosquensts. According to RA UZER-CHERNOUSOVA & FuRSENKO (1959, 0 1509, p. 208) Moscoviella is a ju nior synonym of Ozawainel/a THO~IPSON, 1935. Therefore, in 1·iew of the fact that most Russian paleontologists ha1·e nut accepted Mos .coviella as an established genus, I concur in their decision. V.Carb., Eu.-Asia.

Because of the wide variety of forms included in Q. seminulum by various au.thors, the inadequate original description and figures, and loss of the original type, a neotype was designated from the original type locality and is here figured. The young megalospheric forms of Quinqueloculina were given the generic name Ade/osina by D'ORsIGNY, 1826. The original types of A. laevigata o'ORBIGNY are in the Mu.seum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris. A lectotype is here designated ('1395, pl. 20, figs. 22-24) and redrawn. The original figures show a distinct apertural tooth, but this was apparently broken away since the time of the original description; the tooth does not appear in the present figures. The 2-chambered lectotype and figured paratype, consiscing of proloculus only, are from the Pliocene (Piacenzan) at Cascell'Arquato, Italy. A. laevigata is the megalospheric generation of Q. longirostra n'ORBIGNY, 1826, also described from Castell'Arquato. Lachlane/la was proposed as a subgenus of Quinqueloculina for species with subquadrate chambers, and a high, narrow aperture with elongace, narrow tooth. As these distinctions consist solely of relative dimensions, Lachlanella is here regarded as synonymous with Quinqueloculina.]

[Differs from Sigmoilina in having an agglutinated wall and less enveloping chambers so that more than the final pair are visible externally and the interior does not have the laminated appearance of Sigmoilina. Originally it was described (*717e, p. 270) as differing further in its pos.session of an apertural tooth, but one is also here shown to be present in Sigmoilina. THALMANN (1961, *1905, p. 321) cited the reference to Sigmoilina schlttmbergeri SIL· VESTRI, 1904, and commented "Probably a nomen nudum." Sigmoilina schlumbergeri SILVESTRI, 1904, was defined as a nom. nov., but actually was a new species in· eluding Miliolina celata (CosTA) of BRADY in TtzARD & MURRAY, 1882, and Planispirina celata of BRADY, 1884, SILVESTRI, 1893, and FLINT, 1899, and Sigmoilina (Pl.mi· spirina) celata ScHLUMBERGER, 1887 (non Spiroloculina celata COSTA, 1856). Although no illustrations were pub· lished by SILVESTRI (1904) for this new species, a descrip· cion was given and a reference was m;ide to illustrations by BRADY, 1884, FLINT, 1899, and SCHLUMBERGER, 1887 (in· eluding that here refigured). Hence, this is a valid species and not a nomen nudum. No type-specimen was selected for the present species, although FINLAY, 1947, defined Sigmoilorsis for S. sclzlttmbergeri as interpreted and fig· ured by CUSHMAN, 1946, and BRADY, 1884.

[As defined by SMOUT, the Barkerinidae included only Barkerina, Coxites, and Rabanitina, all characterized by a complexly folded plate subdividing the chambers. Although this is represented only by a small tooth plate in Nezzazata, the similarity in the imperforate granular wall and the Sezzuzata-like juvenile stage of Rabanitina suggests such a rel a tion sh ip. The Barkerinidae are stated not to be agglutin:ued, the granular, commonly recrystallized im· perforate wall suggesting a relationship co the porcelane.ous foraminifers, as noted by SMOUT ('"1 805).

A noticeable similarity of Nummofallotia to sections of Praepeneroplis senoniensis (HoFKER) from the Senonian of the Ne therl ands is ob.served but the recrystallization phenomenon has not been noted in Praepeneroplis, which also lacks indications of secondary transverse septa. The exterior of Nummofal/otia is unknown . Additional study is required in order to determine if Nummo/a/lotia is a junior synonym of Praepeneroplis.

Wall porcelaneous, imperforate. Test free, usually large, coiled about elongate axis, subcylindrical, fusiform, ellipsoidal or spherical, rarely somewhat nautiloid. Pro.loculus followed by spiral tube ( flexostyle ). Juvenile volutions commonly coiled irregu.larly, at least in microspheric form. Cham.bers numerous, divided into tubular cham.berlets by means of secondary partitions ( septula) parallel to direction of coiling; chamberlets may occur in several layers. Apertures numerous, arranged in one or more rows, exceptionally fused into hori.zontal slit. L.Cret.-Rec. 
These features make of the Alveolinidae a morphologically well-defined family but probably not a phylogenetic unit. Some of the genera that followed each other in the course of geological epochs surely did not evolve one from another. 
In their general shape the alveolinids are somewhat isomorphous with fusulinids but between these families no genetic relations exist. The irregular coiling of the first volu.tions found in the microspheric forms of nearly all genera and species shows that the Alveolinidae are closely related to the Milio.lidae. Their relationship with the Penero.plidae is smaller. Yet in Recent Alveolin.ella, HoFKER has observed pores in the wall of the proloculus and peneropline-like coiled first volutions in the microspheric form. It is therefore possible that this genus evolved independently from a peneropline ancestor. Nevertheless, for practical reasons I have placed it in the Alveolinidae. Further study will be needed of the relations between Alveolinella which appears in the Miocene, and the structurally very similar Miocene genus Flosculinella, the microspheric form of which we still do not know. 

The essential feature of the family-axial elongation of the shell-is extremely vari.able. As a rule, the axial diameter is greater than equatorial diameter, but very com.monly both are of the same length (globu.lar tests) and rarely the equatorial diameter is greatest. The ratio of elongation may reach 9:1 in most elongate shells. The shape of .the test also varies greatly. Some genera with only small species (e.g., Oval.veolina, Bullaveolina, Borelis) are repre.sented by shells with axial diameter of 1 to 2 mm. Other genera comprise small as well as large forms (e.g., Praealveolina, Subalveolina, Fasciolites). The largest tests occur in microspheric specimens of Fascio.lites, which may attain a length of 100 mm. (e.g., F. levantina, from the Mediterranean region). 
Internal structure furnishes the most im.portant taxonomic features for distinction of genera (Fig. 391,1-8). Almost invariably a definite type of structure is found to characterize the alveolinids of a given time.stratigraphic division. In the endoskeleton we may distinguish: ( 1) the basal layer (basal thickening), usually well developed in the axial region and in some shells enormously thickened (e.g., "Flosculina") (Fig. 391,6); (2) the secondary partitions or septula which are arranged in the direc.tion of coiling; and ( 3) the floors which divide several layers of chamberlets (e.g., Praealveolina, Alveolinella) (Fig. 391,7,8). 
The septula of two adjacent chambers show either an alternating or a continuous arrangement (Fig. 391,2,3). A section across the chamberlets is circular or oval. The chamberlets of the uppermost layers in Flosculinella and Alveolinella are half the size of those of the lower layers and may be compared with the attics (Fr., man.sardes) of a building. Alveoli are blind chamberlets without an opening at their front. At the back, they are connected with the preceding chamber by means of sec.ondary apertures (e.g., Subalveolina, Bul.lalveolina). Irregularly arranged supple.mentary chamberlets are sometimes seen in the basal layer of certain species of Fascia.

lites ("subgenus Eoalveolinella"). All cham.berlets of the same chamber are connected by a preseptal passage, located in the an.terior part of the chamber. A postseptal passage appears in Fasciolites in the angle between wall and septum at the back of the chamber. In Cisalveolina it occupies the whole posterior part of the chamber and then the preseptal passage is extremely re.duced. 
In a single genus (Multispirina) several spires may be observed. In the megalo.spheric generation the first spires begin on the proloculus, which possesses several rows 
of apertures.  All species  of medium  and  
large  size  show  a  clear  dimorphism  and  
some exhibit trimorphism.  

Fossil alveolinids are only found in neri.tic sediments where they may be associated with miliolids and calcareous algae. Many large species occur in great abundance and are therefore rock-builders (Praealveolina, Cenomanian; Fasciolites, Eocene). 
Alveolinella lives in tropical seas at depths of 10 to 80 m. Bore/is has been found to a depth of 411 m.

[The nominal genus Alveo/ina n'ORBIGNY, 1826, from which the family containing Bore/is has been named and become widely known, is unquestionably a junior objective syn.onym, since Nautilus melo FICHTIL & M OLL, 1798, accord.ing to provisions of the incernational Rules of Nomen.clature, is the type-species of both. For Bore/is this is fix ed by original designation. D'ORBIGNY did not designate any of the 7 species assigned by him to Alveolina as type.species and therefore the first author who selected one of these cl igible species to be the type established it un· alterably.

[D'ORBIGNY's spc:IJing of the specific name "quoii," re· ferring to the surgeon and student of corals J. R. C. QuoY, is indubitably an inadvertent error in which the last letter of the surname was incorrectly changed from "y" to "i ." The Code (An. 32 1a 1ii) provides for automatic correction to "quoyi," as adopted by DouvILLE, CUSHMAN, GALLOWAY 1 and other authors.-R. C. MOORE.}

preference, ingrained by many years of usage, especially on the part of European paleontologists, including me, I have endeavored to find ways of conserv ing the name Alveolina , hallowed by tradition. This is because (I) all authors describing Eocene species from Africa and Europe have used it; (2) since adoption of Alveolina fo r recognition in my structural studies (1931, 1936-37) of the tests, the name has become the symhol of a well-defined and char.acteristic niorphological type that is common to all ob.served Paleocene and Eocene species; (3) deserving respect are the attempts of o 'ORBI CNY to estahlish priority of the name A/l'eolino since "AlvColite de Bose" was the oldest n3me (DESHAYES, 1828, p. 228) without doubt assigned to an Eocene form ( Alveolite grain de jh usque) fi g ured 9 yea rs before the Fasciolites of PARKINSON; and (-1) it has seemed desirable to avoid use of Fasciolites as defined by GALLOWAY on the basis solely of test proportions and size of chamberlets. But unfortun:itely these arguments are insufficient for the Rules of Nomenclature. The term AlvC:o.

nomenclatural rules (Zoo!. Code, 1961, Art. 13,b) relat.
ing to generic names published after 1930. These must be accompanied by definite fixation of a (valid) type· species.

This generic name was first validated in 1962 by HOTTINGER with designation of A/veolina dochelensis ScHWAGER as its type-species. The provisional use of A. dachelensis by Sc HWACER and attribution of G/omalveolina to REI CHEL by HOTTIN GE R have no effect on the validity of A. dachden sis and recog nition of HOTTINGER as author of G/oma/veo/ina.
